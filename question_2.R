# Question 2 (40%): For this question, you will be using the City of Chicago 
# Data Portal to create a choropleth using the ggplot and sf libraries. 
# You should: 1) Download two datasets that interest you, 2) Download one or 
# more shapefiles

# At a minimum you should use the "fill" aes in ggplot to color based on your 
# selected data, but you are free to use others as well. 

# Effort to improve the appearance of your plots relative to the default will 
# be rewarded, as will proper usage of tidyverse style, and loops/containers/
# functions should they be appropriate for your code. 

# Save this code as "question_2.R", and include your downloads from the Data 
# Portal in your repo. Save your chloropleths as .png files and commit them as 
# well. Include 2-4 sentences in the README describing each specific choropleth 
# is about. Also include in your README a description of the datasets and 
# shapefile.
